ZeDoT (Zend Framework - Doctrine - Twig)

This project started with the need to have some sort of integration between
Zend Framework, Doctrine and Twig.

There are lots out there... but as this is an experiment of the whole github
and social development thing, it's always worthy.

Have fun and as always... if you don't like it, fork it!

Cheers,
Luis Ferro
